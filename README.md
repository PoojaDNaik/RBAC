### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checklist-application.git
    cd checklist-application
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you are in the virtual environment, then install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the database initialization script**:
    If you're using a different server or environment, you will need to initialize the database before starting the application. Run the following command to set up the necessary tables:
    ```bash
    python initDB.py
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    Use **uvicorn** to start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```


You need to add your server details in .env files for database connection.
